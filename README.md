In this case we can see how at the start (around 2000-2001) there wasn't almost reviews, but with the past of the time every year we have more and more reviews, and always the one with most numbers are the reviews of 5 stars, we can see that the products are really good or we could also think that there are some sellers who try to fake their reviews to get better reviewss.
